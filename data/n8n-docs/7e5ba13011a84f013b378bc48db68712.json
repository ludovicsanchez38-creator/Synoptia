If the workflow runs in the main process, a soft timeout happens (takes effect after the current node finishes). If a workflow runs in its own process, n8n attempts a soft timeout first, then kills the process after waiting for a fifth of the given timeout duration.\n\nEXECUTIONSTIMEOUT default is -1. For example, if you want to set the timeout to one hour:\n\nYou can also set maximum execution time (in seconds) for each workflow individually. For example, if you want to set maximum execution time to two hours:\n\nRefer to Environment variables reference for more information on these variables.",
