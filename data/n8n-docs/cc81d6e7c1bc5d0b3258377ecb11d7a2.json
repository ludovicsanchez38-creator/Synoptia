Follow technical documentation to integrate S3 node into your workflows.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\npriority: medium\n---\n\n S3 node\n\nUse the S3 node to automate work in non-AWS S3 storage and integrate S3 with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of S3 features, including creating, deleting, and getting buckets, files, and folders. For AWS S3, use AWS S3.\n\nUse the S3 node for non-AWS S3 solutions like:\n\n MinIO\n Wasabi\n Digital Ocean spaces\n\nOn this page, you'll find a list of operations the S3 node supports and links to more resources.\n\n/// note | Credentials\nRefer to S3 credentials for guidance on setting up authentication.\n///\n\n--8<-- \"snippets/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/ai-tools.md\"\n\n Operations\n\n Bucket\n     Create a bucket\n     Delete a bucket\n     Get all buckets\n     Search within a bucket\n File\n     Copy a file\n     Delete a file\n     Download a file\n     Get all files\n     Upload a file\n\n    /// note | Attach file for upload\n    To attach a file for upload, use another node to pass the file as a data property.
