This page provides some example configurations, including using the HTTP node variables.\n\nRefer to HTTP Request for more information on the node.\n\n--8<-- \"snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/http/pagination-api-differences.md\"\n\n Enable pagination\n\nIn the HTTP Request node, select Add Option > Pagination.\n\n Use a URL from the response to get the next page using $response\n\nIf the API returns the URL of the next page in its response:\n\n1. Set Pagination Mode to Response Contains Next URL. n8n displays the parameters for this option.\n1. In Next URL, use an expression to set the URL. The exact expression depends on the data returned by your API. For example, if the API includes a parameter called next-page in the response body:\n\t\n\n Get the next page by number using $pageCount\n\nIf the API you're using supports targeting a specific page by number:\n\n1. Set Pagination Mode to Update a Parameter in Each Request.\n1. Set Type to Query.\n1. Enter the Name of the query parameter. This depends on your API and is usually described in its documentation. For example, some APIs use a query parameter named page to set the page. So Name would be page.\n1. Hover over Value and toggle Expression on.\n1. Enter {{ $pageCount + 1 }}\n\n$pageCount is the number of pages the HTTP Request node has fetched. It starts at zero. Most API pagination counts from one (the first page is page one). This means that adding +1 to $pageCount means the node fetches page one on its first loop, page two on its second, and so on.\n\n Navigate pagination through body parameters\n\nIf the API you're using allows you to paginate through the body parameters:\n\n1. Set the HTTP Request Method to POST\n1. Set Pagination Mode to Update a Parameter in Each Request.\n1. Select Body in the Type parameter.\n1. Enter the Name of the body parameter. This depends on the API you're using. page is a common key name.\n1. Hover over Value and toggle Expression on.\n1. Enter {{ $pageCount + 1 }}\n\n Set the page size in the query\n\nIf the API you're using supports choosing the page size in the query:\n\n1. Select Send Query Parameters in main node parameters (this is the parameters you see when you first open the node, not the settings within options).\n1. Enter the Name of the query parameter. This depends on your API. For example, a lot of APIs use a query parameter named limit to set page size. So Name would be limit.\n1. In Value, enter your page size.",
