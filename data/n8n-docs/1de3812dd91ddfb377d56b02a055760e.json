Includes templates using the node and examples of how to use it.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\npriority: medium\n---\n\n Templates and examples\n\nHere are some templates and examples for the Remove Duplicates node.\n\n/// note | Continuous examples\nThe examples included in this section are a sequence. Follow from one to another to avoid unexpected results.\n///\n\n Templates\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'remove-duplicates') ]]\n\n Set up sample data using the Code node\n\nCreate a workflow with some example input data to try out the Remove Duplicates node.\n\n1. Add a Code node to the canvas and connect it to the Manual Trigger node.\n2. In the Code node, set Mode to Run Once for Each Item and Language to JavaScript.\n3. Paste the following JavaScript code snippet in the JavaScript field:\n\n4. Add a Split Out node to the canvas and connect it to the Code node.\n5. In the Split Out node, enter data in the Fields To Split Out field.\n\n Removing duplicates from the current input\n\n1. Add a Remove Duplicates node to the canvas and connect it to the Split Out node. Choose Remove items repeated within current input as the Action to start.\n2. Open the Remove Duplicates node and ensure that the Operation is set to Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input.\n3. Choose All fields in the Compare field.\n4. Select Execute step to run the Remove Duplicates node, removing duplicated data in the current input.\n\nn8n removes the items that have the same data across all fields. Your output in table view should look like this:\n\n<!-- vale off -->\n| id | name      | job           | lastupdated         |\n|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |\n| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |\n| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |\n| 4      | Bruno Mars    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z |\n| 5      | Billie Eilish | Singer-songwriter | 2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z |\n| 6      | Katy Perry    | Pop star          | 2024-10-08T12:30:45.493Z |\n| 7      | Lady Gaga     | Pop star          | 2024-09-15T14:45:30.493Z |\n| 8      | Rihanna       | Pop star          | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z |\n<!-- vale on -->\n\n5. Open the Remove Duplicates node again and change the Compare parameter to Selected Fields.\n6. In the Fields To Compare field, enter job.\n7. Select Execute step to run the Remove Duplicates node, removing duplicated data in the current input.\n\nn8n removes the items in the current input that have the same job data. Your output in table view should look like this:\n\n<!-- vale off -->\n| id | name      | job           | lastupdated         |\n|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |\n| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |\n<!-- vale on -->\n\n Keep items where the value is new\n\n1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the Operation to Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions.\n2. Set the Keep Items Where parameter to Value Is New.\n3. Set the Value to Dedupe On parameter to {{ $json.name }}.\n4. On the canvas, select Execute workflow to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.\n\nn8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node with this operation, n8n processes all data items and places them into the Kept output tab. The order of the items may be different than the order in the input data:\n\n<!-- vale off -->\n| id | name      | job           | lastupdated         |\n|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |\n| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |\n| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |\n| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |\n| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |\n| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |\n| 4      | Bruno Mars    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z |\n| 5      | Billie Eilish | Singer-songwriter | 2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z |\n| 6      | Katy Perry    | Pop star          | 2024-10-08T12:30:45.493Z |\n| 7      | Lady Gaga     | Pop star          | 2024-09-15T14:45:30.493Z |\n| 8      | Rihanna       | Pop star          | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z |\n<!-- vale on -->\n\n/// note | Items are only compared against previous executions\nThe current input items are only compared against the stored items from previous executions. This means that items repeated within the current input aren't removed in this mode of operation. If you need to remove duplicate items within the current input and across executions, connect two Remove Duplicate nodes together sequentially. Set the first to use the Remove Items Repated Within Current Input operation and the second to use the Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions operation.\n///\n\n5. Open the Code node and uncomment (remove the // from) the line for \"Tom Hanks.\"\n6. On the canvas, select Execute workflow again. Open the Remove Duplicates node again to examine the results.\n\nn8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. This time, the Kept tab contains the one new record from the Code node:\n\n<!-- vale off -->\n| id | name  | job | lastupdated         |\n|--------|-----------|---------|--------------------------|\n| 9      | Tom Hanks | Actor   | 2024-10-17T13:58:31.493Z |\n<!-- vale on -->\n\nThe Discarded tab contains the items processed by the previous execution:\n\n<!-- vale off -->\n| id | name      | job           | lastupdated         |\n|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|\n| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |\n| 1      | Taylor Swift  | Pop star          | 2024-09-20T10:12:43.493Z |\n| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |\n| 2      | Ed Sheeran    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-05T08:30:59.493Z |\n| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |\n| 3      | Adele         | Singer-songwriter | 2024-10-07T14:15:59.493Z |\n| 4      | Bruno Mars    | Singer-songwriter | 2024-08-25T17:45:12.493Z |\n| 5      | Billie Eilish | Singer-songwriter | 2024-09-10T09:30:12.493Z |\n| 6      | Katy Perry    | Pop star          | 2024-10-08T12:30:45.493Z |\n| 7      | Lady Gaga     | Pop star          | 2024-09-15T14:45:30.493Z |\n| 8      | Rihanna       | Pop star          | 2024-10-01T11:50:22.493Z |\n<!-- vale on -->\n\nBefore continuing, clear the duplication history to get ready for the next example:\n\n7. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the Operation to Clear Deduplication History.\n8. Select Execute step to clear the current duplication history.\n\n Keep items where the value is higher than any previous value\n\n1. Open the Remove Duplicates node and set the Operation to Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions.\n2. Set the Keep Items Where parameter to Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value.\n3. Set the Value to Dedupe On parameter to {{ $json.id }}.\n4. On the canvas, select Execute workflow to run the workflow. Open the Remove Duplicates node to examine the results.\n\nn8n compares the current input data to the items stored from previous executions. Since this is the first time running the Remove Duplicates node after clearing the history, n8n processes all data items and places them into ",
