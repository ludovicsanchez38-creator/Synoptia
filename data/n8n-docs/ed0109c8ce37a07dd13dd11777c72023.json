Follow technical documentation to integrate AI Agent node into your workflows.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\npriority: critical\n---\n\n AI Agent node\n\nAn AI agent is an autonomous system that receives data, makes rational decisions, and acts within its environment to achieve specific goals. The AI agent's environment is everything the agent can access that isn't the agent itself. This agent uses external tools and APIs to perform actions and retrieve information. It can understand the capabilities of different tools and determine which tool to use depending on the task. \n\n/// note | Connect a tool\nYou must connect at least one tool sub-node to an AI Agent node.\n///\n\n/// note | Agent type\nPrior to version 1.82.0, the AI Agent had a setting for working as different agent types. This has now been removed and all AI Agent nodes work as a Tools Agent which was the recommended and most frequently used setting. If you're working with older versions of the AI Agent in workflows or templates, as long as they were set to 'Tools Agent', they should continue to behave as intended with the updated node.\n///\n\n Templates and examples\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'agent') ]]\n\n Related resources\n\nRefer to LangChain's documentation on agents for more information about the service.\n\nNew to AI Agents?
