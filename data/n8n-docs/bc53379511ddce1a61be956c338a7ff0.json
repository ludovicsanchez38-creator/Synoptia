It's possible to lift that restriction for built-in and external modules by setting the following environment variables:\n\n- NODEFUNCTIONALLOWBUILTIN: For built-in modules\n- NODEFUNCTIONALLOWEXTERNAL: For external modules sourced from n8n/nodemodules directory. External module support is disabled when an environment variable isn't set.\n\n/// note | If using Task Runners\nIf n8n instance is setup with Task Runners, add the environment variables to the Task Runners instead to the main n8n node.\n///\n\nRefer to Environment variables reference for more information on these variables.",
