It doesn't indicate DB status. It's available for both self-hosted and Cloud users.\n\nAccess the endpoint:\n\nThe /healthz/readiness endpoint is similar to the /healthz endpoint, but it returns a HTTP status code of 200 if the DB is connected and migrated and therefore the instance is ready to accept traffic.\n\nAccess the endpoint:\n\n metrics\n\nThe /metrics endpoint provides more detailed information about the current status of the instance.\n\nAccess the endpoint:\n\n/// info | Feature availability\nThe /metrics endpoint isn't available on n8n Cloud.\n///\n<!-- vale off -->\n Enable metrics and healthz for self-hosted n8n\n<!-- vale on -->\nThe /metrics and /healthz endpoints are disabled by default.
