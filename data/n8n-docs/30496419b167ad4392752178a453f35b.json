Users can override this for individual workflows up to the duration set in EXECUTIONSTIMEOUTMAX. Set EXECUTIONSTIMEOUT to -1 to disable. |\n| EXECUTIONSTIMEOUTMAX | Number | 3600 | The maximum execution time (in seconds) that users can set for an individual workflow. |\n| EXECUTIONSDATASAVEONERROR | Enum string: all, none | all | Whether n8n saves execution data on error. |\n| EXECUTIONSDATASAVEONSUCCESS | Enum string: all, none | all | Whether n8n saves execution data on success. |\n| EXECUTIONSDATASAVEONPROGRESS | Boolean | false | Whether to save progress for each node executed (true) or not (false). |\n| EXECUTIONSDATASAVEMANUALEXECUTIONS | Boolean | true | Whether to save data of executions when started manually. |\n| EXECUTIONSDATAPRUNE | Boolean | true | Whether to delete data of past executions on a rolling basis. |\n| EXECUTIONSDATAMAXAGE | Number | 336 | The execution age (in hours) before it's deleted. |\n| EXECUTIONSDATAPRUNEMAXCOUNT | Number | 10000 | Maximum number of executions to keep in the database. 0 = no limit |\n| EXECUTIONSDATAHARDDELETEBUFFER | Number | 1 | How old (hours) the finished execution data has to be to get hard-deleted. By default, this buffer excludes recent executions as the user may need them while building a workflow. |\n| EXECUTIONSDATAPRUNEHARDDELETEINTERVAL | Number | 15 | How often (minutes) execution data should be hard-deleted. |\n| EXECUTIONSDATAPRUNESOFTDELETEINTERVAL | Number | 60 | How often (minutes) execution data should be soft-deleted. |\n| N8NCONCURRENCYPRODUCTIONLIMIT | Number | -1 | Max production executions allowed to run concurrently, in both regular and scaling modes. -1 to disable in regular mode. |",
