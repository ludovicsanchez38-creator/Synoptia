Follow technical documentation to integrate KoboToolbox Trigger node into your workflows.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\n---\n\n KoboToolbox Trigger node\n\nKoboToolbox is a field survey and data collection tool to design interactive forms to be completed offline from mobile devices. It's available both as a free cloud solution or as a self-hosted version.\n\n/// note | Credentials\nYou can find authentication information for this node here.\n///\n\n///  note  | Examples and templates\nFor usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's KoboToolbox Trigger integrations page.\n///\n\nThis node starts a workflow upon new submissions of a specified form. The trigger node handles the creation/deletion of the hook, so you don't need to do any setup in KoboToolbox.\n\nIt works the same way as the Get Submission operation in the KoboToolbox node, including supporting the same reformatting options.",
