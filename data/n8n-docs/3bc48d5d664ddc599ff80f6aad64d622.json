Select Execute Workflow to start a manual execution. You can do manual executions of active workflows, but n8n recommends keeping your workflow set to Inactive while developing and testing.\n Production: a production workflow is one that runs automatically. To enable this, set the workflow to Active.\n\n Execution lists\n\nn8n provides two execution lists:\n\n Workflow-level executions: this execution list shows the executions for a single workflow.\n All executions: this list shows all executions for all your workflows.\n\nn8n supports adding custom data to executions.",
