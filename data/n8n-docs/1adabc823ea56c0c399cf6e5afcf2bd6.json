Required when using external mode. |\n| N8NRUNNERSBROKERPORT | Number | 5679 | Port the task broker listens on for task runner connections. |\n| N8NRUNNERSBROKERLISTENADDRESS | String | 127.0.0.1 | Address the task broker listens on. |\n| N8NRUNNERSMAXPAYLOAD | Number | 1 073 741 824 | Maximum payload size in bytes for communication between a task broker and a task runner. |\n| N8NRUNNERSMAXOLDSPACESIZE | String |  | The --max-old-space-size option to use for a task runner (in MB). By default, Node.js will set this based on available memory. |\n| N8NRUNNERSMAXCONCURRENCY | Number | 5 | The number of concurrent tasks a task runner can execute at a time. |\n| N8NRUNNERSTASKTIMEOUT | Number | 60 | How long (in seconds) a task can take to complete before the task aborts and the runner restarts. Must be greater than 0. |\n| N8NRUNNERSHEARTBEATINTERVAL | Number | 30 | How often (in seconds) the runner must send a heartbeat to the broker, else the task aborts and the runner restarts. Must be greater than 0. |\n| N8NRUNNERSINSECUREMODE | Boolean | false | Whether to disable all security measures in the task runner, for compatibility with modules that rely on insecure JS features. Discouraged for production use. |\n\n Task runner launcher environment variables\n\n| Variable | Type  | Default  | Description |\n| :------- | :---- | :------- | :---------- |\n| N8NRUNNERSLAUNCHERLOGLEVEL | Enum string: debug, info, warn, error | info | Which log messages to show. |\n| N8NRUNNERSAUTHTOKEN | String | - | Shared secret used to authenticate to n8n. |\n| N8NRUNNERSAUTOSHUTDOWNTIMEOUT | Number | 15 | The number of seconds to wait before shutting down an idle runner. |\n| N8NRUNNERSTASKBROKERURI | String | http://127.0.0.1:5679 | The URI of the task broker server (n8n instance). |\n| N8NRUNNERSLAUNCHERHEALTHCHECKPORT | Number | 5680 | Port for the launcher's health check server. |\n| N8NRUNNERSMAXPAYLOAD | Number | 1 073 741 824 | Maximum payload size in bytes for communication between a task broker and a task runner. |\n| N8NRUNNERSMAXCONCURRENCY | Number | 5 | The number of concurrent tasks a task runner can execute at a time. |\n\n Task runner environment variables (all languages)\n\n| Variable | Type  | Default  | Description |\n| :------- | :---- | :------- | :---------- |\n| N8NRUNNERSGRANTTOKEN | String | Random string | Token the runner uses to authenticate with the task broker. This is automatically provided by the launcher. |\n| N8NRUNNERSAUTOSHUTDOWNTIMEOUT | Number | 15 | The number of seconds to wait before shutting down an idle runner. |\n| N8NRUNNERSTASKBROKERURI | String | http://127.0.0.1:5679 | The URI of the task broker server (n8n instance). |\n| N8NRUNNERSLAUNCHERHEALTHCHECKPORT | Number | 5680 | Port for the launcher's health check server. |\n| N8NRUNNERSMAXPAYLOAD | Number | 1 073 741 824 | Maximum payload size in bytes for communication between a task broker and a task runner. |\n| N8NRUNNERSMAXCONCURRENCY | Number | 5 | The number of concurrent tasks a task runner can execute at a time. |\n\n Task runner environment variables (JavaScript)\n\n| Variable | Type  | Default  | Description |\n| :------- | :---- | :------- | :---------- |\n| NODEFUNCTIONALLOWBUILTIN | String | - | Permit users to import specific built-in modules in the Code node. Use  to allow all. n8n disables importing modules by default. |\n| NODEFUNCTIONALLOWEXTERNAL | String | - | Permit users to import specific external modules (from n8n/nodemodules) in the Code node. n8n disables importing modules by default. |\n| N8NRUNNERSALLOWPROTOTYPEMUTATION | Boolean | false | Whether to allow prototype mutation for external libraries. Set to true to allow modules that rely on runtime prototype mutation (for example, puppeteer) at the cost of relaxing security. | \n| GENERICTIMEZONE |  | America/NewYork | The same default timezone as configured for the n8n instance. |\n| NODEOPTIONS | String | - | Options for Node.js. |\n| N8NRUNNERSMAXOLDSPACESIZE | String |  | The --max-old-space-size option to use for a task runner (in MB). By default, Node.js will set this based on available memory. |\n\n Task runner environment variables (Python)\n\n| Variable | Type  | Default  | Description |\n| :------- | :---- | :------- | :---------- |\n| N8NRUNNERSSTDLIBALLOW | String | - | Python standard library modules that you can use in the Code node, including their submodules. Use  to allow all stdlib modules. n8n disables all Python standard library imports by default. |\n| N8NRUNNERSEXTERNALALLOW | String | - | Third-party Python modules that are allowed to be used in the Code node, including their submodules. Use  to allow all external modules. n8n disables all third-party Python modules by default. Third-party Python modules must be included in the n8nio/runners image. |\n| N8NRUNNERSBUILTINSDENY | String | eval,exec,compile,open,input,breakpoint,getattr,object,type,vars,setattr,delattr,hasattr,dir,memoryview,buildclass,globals,locals | Python built-ins that you can't use in the Code node. Set to an empty string to allow all built-ins. |",
