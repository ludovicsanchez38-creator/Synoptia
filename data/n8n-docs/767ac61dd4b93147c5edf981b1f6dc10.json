  "content": "---\ntitle: AI Agent Tool node documentation\ndescription: Learn how to use the AI Agent Tool node in n8n. Follow technical documentation to integrate the AI Agent Tool node into your workflows.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\npriority: high\n---\n\n AI Agent Tool node\n\nThe AI Agent Tool node allows a root-level agent in your workflow to call other agents as tools to simplify multi-agent orchestration.\n\nThe primary agent can supervise and delegate work to AI Agent Tool nodes that specialize in different tasks and knowledge. This allows you to use multiple agents in a single workflow without the complexity of managing context and variables that sub-workflows require. You can nest AI Agent Tool nodes into multiple layers for more complex multi-tiered use cases.\n\nOn this page, you'll find the node parameters for the AI Agent Tool node, and links to more resources.\n\n--8<-- \"snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-node-expression-resolution.md\"\n\n Node parameters\n\nConfigure the AI Agent Tool node using these parameters:\n\n Description: Give a description to the LLM of this agent's purpose and scope of responsibility. A good, specific description tells the parent agent when to delegate tasks to this agent for processing.\n Prompt (User Message): The prompt to the LLM explaining what actions to perform and what information to return.\n Require Specific Output Format: Whether you want the node to require a specific output format. When turned on, n8n prompts you to connect one of the output parsers described on the main agent page.\n Enable Fallback Model: Whether to enable a fallback model. When enabled, n8n prompts you to connect a backup chat model to use in case the primary model fails or isn't available.\n\n Node options\n\nRefine the AI Agent Tool node's behavior using these options:\n\n System Message: A message to send to the agent before the conversation starts.\n Max Iterations: The maximum number of times the model should run to generate a response before stopping.\n Return Intermediate Steps: Whether to include intermediate steps the agent took in the final output.\n Automatically Passthrough Binary Images: Whether binary images should be automatically passed through to the agent as image type messages.\n Batch Processing: Whether to enable the following batch processing options for rate limiting:\n\t Batch Size: The number of items to process in parallel. This helps with rate limiting but may impact the log output ordering.\n\t Delay Between Batches: The number of milliseconds to wait between batches.\n\n Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'ai-agent-tool') ]]\n\n Dynamic parameters for tools with $fromAI()\n\nTo learn how to dynamically populate parameters for app node tools, refer to Let AI specify tool parameters with $fromAI().",
