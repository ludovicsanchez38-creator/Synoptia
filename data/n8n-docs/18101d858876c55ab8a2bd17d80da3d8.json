Select Listen for test event to register the webhook before sending the data to the test webhook. The test webhook stays active for 120 seconds.\n\nWhen using the Webhook node on localhost on a self-hosted n8n instance, run n8n in tunnel mode:\n\n npm with tunnel\n Docker with tunnel\n\n<video src=\"/video/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/webhook/webhook-node-intro.mp4\" controls width=\"100%\"></video>\n\n Production workflows\n\nWhen your workflow is ready, switch to using the Production webhook URL. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when an external service calls the webhook URL.\n\nWhen working with a Production webhook, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the webhook isn't visible in the editor UI with the production webhook.\n\nRefer to Create a workflow for more information on activating workflows.",
