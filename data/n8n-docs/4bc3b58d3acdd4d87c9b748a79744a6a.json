If your command isn't included in the container, you might have to extend the official n8n image with a custom image that includes your command.\n\t If n8n is already running:\n\t\t\n\t If n8n isn't running:\n\t\t\n\n<!-- vale off -->\n Error: stdout maxBuffer length exceeded\n<!-- vale on -->\n\nThis error happens when your command returns more output than the Execute Command node is able to process at one time.\n\nTo avoid this error, reduce output your command produces. Check your command's manual page or documentation to see if there are flags to limit or filter output. If not, you may need to pipe the output to another command to remove unneeded info.",
