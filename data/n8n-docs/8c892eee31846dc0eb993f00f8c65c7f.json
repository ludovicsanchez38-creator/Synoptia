Includes details of the issue and suggested solutions.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\npriority: high\n---\n\n Simple Memory node common issues\n\nHere are some common errors and issues with the Simple Memory node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them.\n\n Single memory instance\n\nIf you add more than one Simple Memory node to your workflow, all nodes access the same memory instance by default. Be careful when doing destructive actions that override existing memory contents, such as the override all messages operation in the Chat Memory Manager node. If you want more than one memory instance in your workflow, set different session IDs in different memory nodes.\n\n Managing the Session ID\n\nIn most cases, the sessionId is automatically retrieved from the On Chat Message trigger. But you may run into an error with the phrase No sessionId.\n\nIf you have this error, first check the output of your Chat trigger to ensure it includes a sessionId.\n\nIf you're not using the On Chat Message trigger, you'll need to manage sessions manually.\n\nFor testing purposes, you can use a static key like mytestsession. If you use this approach, be sure to set up proper session management before activating the workflow to avoid potential issues in a live environment.",
