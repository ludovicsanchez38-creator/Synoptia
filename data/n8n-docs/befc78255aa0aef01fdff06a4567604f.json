Configure your n8n instance to use your SMTP server.\n2. Start n8n and follow the setup steps in the app.\n3. Invite users.\n\n Step one: SMTP\n\nn8n recommends setting up an SMTP server, for user invites and password resets. \n\n/// note | Optional from 0.210.1\nFrom version 0.210.1 onward, this step is optional. You can choose to manually copy and send invite links instead of setting up SMTP. Note that if you skip this step, users can't reset passwords.\n///\nGet the following information from your SMTP provider:\n\n Server name\n SMTP username\n SMTP password\n SMTP sender name\n\nTo set up SMTP with n8n, configure the SMTP environment variables for your n8n instance. For information on how to set environment variables, refer to Configuration\n<!-- vale off -->\n| Variable | Type | Description | Required? |\n| -------- | ---- | ----------- | --------- |\n| N8NEMAILMODE | string | smtp | Required |\n| N8NSMTPHOST | string | yourSMTPservername | Required |\n| N8NSMTPPORT | number | yourSMTPserverport Default is 465.| Optional |\n| N8NSMTPUSER | string | yourSMTPusername | Optional |\n| N8NSMTPPASS | string | yourSMTPpassword | Optional |\n| N8NSMTPOAUTHSERVICECLIENT | string | yourOAuthserviceclient | Optional |\n| N8NSMTPOAUTHPRIVATEKEY | string | yourOAuthprivatekey | Optional |\n| N8NSMTPSENDER | string | Sender email address.
