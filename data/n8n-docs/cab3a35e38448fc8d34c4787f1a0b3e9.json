  "content": "---\ntitle: Conversational AI Agent node documentation\ndescription: Learn how to use the Conversational Agent of the AI Agent node in n8n. Follow technical documentation to integrate the Conversational Agent into your workflows.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\npriority: critical\n---\n\n Conversational AI Agent node\n\n/// note | Feature removed\nn8n removed this functionality in February 2025.\n///\n\nThe Conversational Agent has human-like conversations. It can maintain context, understand user intent, and provide relevant answers. This agent is typically used for building chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems.\n\nThe Conversational Agent describes tools in the system prompt and parses JSON responses for tool calls. If your preferred AI model doesn't support tool calling or you're handling simpler interactions, this agent is a good general option. It's more flexible but may be less accurate than the Tools Agent.\n\nRefer to AI Agent for more information on the AI Agent node itself.\n\n--8<-- \"snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/use-with-chat-trigger.md\"\n\n Node parameters\n\nConfigure the Conversational Agent using the following parameters.\n\n Prompt\n\n--8<-- \"snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/prompt.md\"\n\n Require Specific Output Format\n\n--8<-- \"snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/output-format.md\"\n\n Node options\n\nRefine the Conversational Agent node's behavior using these options:\n\n Human Message\n\nTell the agent about the tools it can use and add context to the user's input.\n\nYou must include these expressions and variable:\n\n {tools}: A LangChain expression that provides a string of the tools you've connected to the Agent. Provide some context or explanation about who should use the tools and how they should use them.\n {formatinstructions}: A LangChain expression that provides the schema or format from the output parser node you've connected. Since the instructions themselves are context, you don't need to provide context for this expression.\n {{input}}: A LangChain variable containing the user's prompt. This variable populates with the value of the Prompt parameter. Provide some context that this is the user's input.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use these strings:\n\nExample:\n\n System Message \n\n--8<-- \"snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/system-message.md\"\n\n Max Iterations\n\n--8<-- \"snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/max-iterations.md\"\n\n Return Intermediate Steps\n\n--8<-- \"snippets/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/langchain-root-nodes/return-intermediate-steps.md\"\n\n Templates and examples\n\nRefer to the main AI Agent node's Templates and examples section.\n\n Common issues\n\nFor common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to Common issues.",
