This is helpful if your users might be untrustworthy.\n\nUse the NODESEXCLUDE environment variable to prevent your users from accessing specific nodes.\n\n Exclude nodes\n\nUpdate your NODESEXCLUDE environment variable to include an array of strings containing any nodes you want to block your users from using.\n\nFor example, setting the variable this way:\n\nBlocks the Execute Command and Read/Write Files from Disk nodes.\n\nYour n8n users won't be able to search for or use these nodes.\n\n Suggested nodes to block\n\nThe nodes that can pose security risks vary based on your use case and user profile.
