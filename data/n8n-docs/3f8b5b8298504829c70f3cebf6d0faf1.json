To fetch issues for a particular project, you need to use Jira Query Language (JQL).\n\nFor example, if you want to receive all the issues of a project named n8n, you'd do something like this:\n\n- Select Get All from the Operation dropdown list.\n- Toggle Return All to true.\n- Select Add Option and select JQL.\n- Enter project=n8n in the JQL field.\n\nThis query will fetch all the issues in the project named n8n. Enter the name of your project instead of n8n to fetch all the issues for your project.",
