It should be the first node in the workflow.\n\nn8n allows you to call workflows from other workflows. This is useful if you want to:\n\n Reuse a workflow: for example, you could have multiple workflows pulling and processing data from different sources, then have all those workflows call a single workflow that generates a report.\n Break large workflows into smaller components.\n\n Usage\n\nThis node runs in response to a call from the Execute Sub-workflow or Call n8n Workflow Tool nodes.\n\n--8<-- \"snippets/flow-logic/subworkflow-usage.md\"\n\n Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'execute-workflow-trigger') ]]\n\n How data passes between workflows\n\n--8<-- \"snippets/flow-logic/subworkflow-data-flow.md\"",
