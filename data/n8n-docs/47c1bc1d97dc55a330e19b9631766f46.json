Includes guidance on usage, and links to examples.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\npriority: critical\n---\n\n Switch\n\nUse the Switch node to route a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations. It's similar to the IF node, but supports multiple output routes.\n\n Node parameters\n\nSelect the Mode the node should use:\n\n Rules: Select this mode to build a matching rule for each output.\n Expression: Select this mode to write an expression to return the output index programmatically.\n\nNode configuration depends on the Mode you select.\n\n Rules\n\nTo configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:\n\n Create Routing Rules to define comparison conditions.\n     Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to create a rules for dates after a particular date, select Date & Time > is after.\n     The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to Available data type comparisons for a full list of all comparisons by data type.\n Rename Output: Turn this control on to rename the output field to put matching data into. Enter your desired Output Name.\n\nSelect Add Routing Rule to add more rules.\n\n Rule options\n\nYou can further configure the node with this operation using these Options:\n\n- Fallback Output: Choose how to route the workflow when an item doesn't match any of the rules or conditions.\n    - None: Ignore the item. This is the default behavior.\n    - Extra Output: Send items to an extra, separate output.\n    - Output 0: Send items to the same output as those matching the first rule.\n- Ignore Case: Set whether to ignore letter case when evaluating conditions (turned on) or enforce letter case (turned off).\n- Less Strict Type Validation: Set whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off).\n- Send data to all matching outputs: Set whether to send data to all outputs meeting conditions (turned on) or whether to send the data to the first output matching the conditions (turned off).\n\n Expression\n\nTo configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:\n\n- Number of Outputs: Set how many outputs the node should have.\n- Output Index: Create an expression to calculate which input item should be routed to which output. The expression must return a number.\n\n Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'switch') ]]\n\n Related resources\n\nRefer to Splitting with conditionals for more information on using conditionals to create complex logic in n8n.\n\n--8<-- \"snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/data-types.md\"",
