If the key isn't yet in the settings file,\nyou can set it using an environment variable, so that n8n \nuses your custom key instead of generating a new one.\n\nIn queue mode, you must specify the encryption key environment variable for all workers.\n\nRefer to Environment variables reference for more information on this variable.",
