Follow technical documentation to integrate Evaluation Trigger node into your workflows.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\n---\n\n Evaluation Trigger node\n\nUse the Evaluation Trigger node when setting up evaluations to validate your AI workflow reliability. During evaluation, the Evaluation Trigger node reads your evaluation dataset from Google Sheets, sending the items through the workflow one at a time, in sequence.\n\nOn this page, you'll find the Evaluation Trigger node parameters and options.\n\n/// note | Credentials for Google Sheets\nThe Evaluation Trigger node uses data tables or Google Sheets to store the test dataset. To use Google Sheets as a dataset source, configure a Google Sheets credential.\n///\n\n Parameters\n\n- Source: Select the location to which you want to output the evaluation results. Default value is Data table.\n\n    Source settings differ depending on Source selection.\n\n     When Source is Data table:\n         Data table: Select a data table by name or ID.\n         Limit Rows: Whether to limit the number of rows in the data table to process. Default state is off.\n             Max Rows to Process: When Limit Rows is enabled, the maximum number of rows to read and process during the evaluation. Default value is 10.\n             Filter Rows: Whether to filter rows in the data table to process. Default state is off.\n      When Source is Google Sheets:\n        - Credential to connect with: Create or select an existing Google Sheets credentials.\n         Document Containing Dataset: Choose the spreadsheet document with the sheet containing your test dataset.\n            - Select From list to choose the spreadsheet title from the dropdown list, By URL to enter the url of the spreadsheet, or By ID to enter the spreadsheetId. \n            - You can find the spreadsheetId in a Google Sheets URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/spreadsheetId/editgid=0.\n         Sheet Containing Dataset: Choose the sheet containing your test dataset.\n            - Select From list to choose the sheet title from the dropdown list, By URL to enter the url of the sheet, By ID to enter the sheetId, or By Name to enter the sheet title. \n            - You can find the sheetId in a Google Sheets URL: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/aBC-123xYz/editgid=sheetId. \n         Limit Rows: Whether to limit the number of rows in the sheet to process.\n             Max Rows to Process: When Limit Rows is enabled, the maximum number of rows to read and process during the evaluation.\n         Filters: Filter the evaluation dataset based on column values.\n             Column: Choose a sheet column you want to filter by. Select From list to choose the column name from the dropdown list, or By ID to specify an ID using an expression.\n             Value: The column value you want to filter by. The evaluation will only process rows with the given value for the selected column.\n\n Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'evaluation-trigger') ]]\n\n Related resources\n\nTo learn more about n8n evaluations, check out the evaluations documentation\n\nn8n provides an app node for evaluations.
