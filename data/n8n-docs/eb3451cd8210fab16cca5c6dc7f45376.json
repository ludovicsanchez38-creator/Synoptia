Follow technical documentation to integrate Local File Trigger node into your workflows.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\npriority: high\n---\n\n Local File Trigger node\n\nThe Local File Trigger node starts a workflow when it detects changes on the file system. These changes involve a file or folder getting added, changed, or deleted.\n\n/// note | Self-hosted n8n only\nThis node isn't available on n8n Cloud.\n///\n\n Node parameters\n\nYou can choose what event to watch for using the Trigger On parameter.\n\n Changes to a Specific File\n\nThe node triggers when the specified file changes.\n\nEnter the path for the file to watch in File to Watch.\n\n Changes Involving a Specific Folder\n\nThe node triggers when a change occurs in the selected folder.\n\nConfigure these parameters:\n\n- Folder to Watch: Enter the path of the folder to watch.\n- Watch for: Select the type of change to watch for.\n\n Node options\n\nUse the node Options to include or exclude files and folders.\n\n- Include Linked Files/Folders: also watch for changes to linked files or folders.\n- Ignore: files or paths to ignore. n8n tests the whole path, not just the filename. Supports the Anymatch syntax.\n- Max Folder Depth: how deep into the folder structure to watch for changes.\n\n Examples for Ignore\n\nIgnore a single file:\n\nIgnore a sub-directory of a directory you're watching:\n\n Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'local-file-trigger') ]]",
