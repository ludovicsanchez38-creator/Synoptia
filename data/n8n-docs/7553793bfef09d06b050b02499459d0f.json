Follow technical documentation to integrate Google Drive Trigger node into your workflows.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\npriority: medium\n---\n\n Google Drive Trigger node\n\nGoogle Drive is a file storage and synchronization service developed by Google. It allows users to store files on their servers, synchronize files across devices, and share files.\n\n/// note | Credentials\nYou can find authentication information for this node here.\n///\n\n///  note  | Examples and templates\nFor usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's Google Drive Trigger integrations page.\n///\n\n/// note | Manual Executions vs. Activation\nOn manual executions this node will return the last event matching its search criteria. If no event matches the criteria (for example because you are watching for files to be created but no files have been created so far), an error is thrown. Once saved and activated, the node will regularly check for any matching events and will trigger your workflow for each event found.\n///\n\n Common issues\n\nFor common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to Common issues.",
